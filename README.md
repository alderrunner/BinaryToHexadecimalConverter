# Binary To Hexadecimal Converter

After watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yypxodcVI9M) video, I thought I could program the algorithm in Python. So here is my implementation. If you find any mistakes please let me know.

## Usage

- Execute the file from wherever you want
- Enter a binary number that you want to convert into a hexadecimal number
- Then you get an output with your number in the hexadecimal system
